"""Pre-export check, rules layer: what counts as broken, and how to name it.

Three separate questions, deliberately kept apart from the operator that runs
them so each can be checked offline (``tests/test_pre_export_check.py``):

1. **Does a texture binding resolve?**  A path is fine if it is a vanilla game
   asset or if the file is actually on disk under the user's mod root.
   Anything else is a dangling reference the game will fail on.
2. **Do the meshes and the materials line up?**  RE Mesh derives a submesh's
   material name from its object name, so a mesh whose derived name matches no
   material -- or a material no mesh asks for -- is a broken export.
3. **Is a material name legal?**  Separate from (2) because an illegal name can
   match perfectly and still export wrong.

**The legality rules are not RE Mesh Editor's.**  Its exporter does
``name.split("__", 1)[1].split(".")[0]``, which truncates at the *first* dot --
so ``Mat.Body`` silently exports as ``Mat``.  Since people do name materials
that way, following the exporter's parse verbatim would make this check declare
a name fine and then have it export as something else.  This module instead
strips only Blender's own ``.NNN`` de-duplication suffix and judges the rest,
which is what the user actually typed.
