"""RE Mdf port, operator: run mdf_port.plan_material on a real .mdf2 collection.

Mirrors two existing patterns rather than inventing a third:

- ``core/mesh_port_ops.py``'s ``modder.port_mesh_cross_game`` and
  ``core/chain_convert_ops.py``'s ``modder.convert_chain_cross_game`` -- one
  game-agnostic operator, ``source_game`` fixed by which per-game UI section
  calls it, a whole source *collection* picked (not a hand-picked object
  selection), defaulted from the active object's own collection, and enabled
  whenever there is anything to port anywhere in the file rather than gated on
  the current selection. The result lands in a *new* collection next to the
  original rather than mutating it in place.
- ``core/mdf_material_convert_base.py``'s same-game convert -- read the old
  material's bindings, build the new one from a preset, copy the custom textures
  across.  The cross-game difference is everything downstream of "which bindings
  copy": the target's slot vocabulary and channel packing can differ (see
  ``core/mdf_port_tex.py``), so a straight ``old_path`` copy is not enough here.

Params are migrated selectively, not wholesale: the shader's Property List is
game-specific, so which entries mean the same thing on both sides is its own
question -- ``core/mdf_port_params.py`` answers it, and ``migrate_params`` picks
how far to take the answer.
