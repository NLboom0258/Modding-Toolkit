"""RE Mesh port, planning layer: what has to happen to a rig to make it another
game's rig.

Named after the mesh rather than the skeleton on purpose: across RE Engine games the
mesh itself needs nothing -- same naming system, same data -- so "porting a mesh"
*is* porting its rig.  ``core/chain_convert.py`` is the physics half and depends on
this one: a chain can only be ported onto a rig that has already been ported, and
**both must consume the same rename map** (``core.bone_mapper.build_cross_game_map``).
Two copies of that mapping drifting apart puts a collider on the wrong bone, and per
memory ``reference_mhwmodfixer`` broken chain physics fails *at boot only* -- nothing
static catches it.

Four things happen to a source bone, and the split is not symmetric:

* **rename** -- the mapping gives a target name nothing else claims.
* **merge** -- several source bones map to one target bone (MHWilds' ``_HJ_`` helpers
  collapsing onto their base, ``L_Knee`` onto ``L_Shin``).  They must be *merged*, not
  kept and not dropped: keeping an extra joint between two base bones breaks animation
  (channels are resolved by name hash, so an unreferenced link in the middle drives
  the tip to the wrong place), while dropping one throws away vertex weights.  Only
  leaf bones -- hair, cloth -- can multiply freely, because nothing animates them.
* **pass through** -- no mapping at all *and* not part of the source game's own
  skeleton.  This is the correct outcome for per-asset hair/cloth/prop bones: they
  travel with the model, so their names, and therefore their hashes, already match in
  the target game.

  Rig furniture is the opposite case and used to be lumped in here, wrongly.  A bone
  like ``L_Elbow_HJ_00`` belongs to *MHWilds' skeleton*, not to the model: the target
  game has no such bone, nothing will ever animate it, and keeping it just inflates
  the rig -- while the helpers that happen to be registered in the preset were being
  merged, so half the same family survived and half did not, for no reason a user
  could see.  A source bone that is in the source game's **native** skeleton but has
  no mapping now merges into its nearest mapped ancestor, weights included.
* **insert** -- the reverse direction's problem: the target game has a base bone the
  source rig lacks.  Same animation argument in reverse, so it has to be synthesised.

Insertion is deliberately limited to the curated table below rather than "every bone
the reference rig has".  The bundled reference models are whole characters, so their
bone lists include that character's own hair and cloth; inserting those into someone
else's model would be nonsense.  Anything a target rig wants that is not in the table
is *reported*, never guessed -- the same rule ``chain_convert`` follows for unmapped
collider attach points.

Placement rules come from measurement, not intuition:

* ``Palm`` sits **at** ``Hand``, not at the midpoint between ``Hand`` and the finger
  roots it parents.  Measured against the real bone on four rigs (mm off): RE9 Leon
  33.6 vs 36.4, RE9 Grace 25.4 vs 31.7, MHWS 12.0 vs 47.0, RE4 Leon 27.9 vs 27.5.
  Co-locating on ``Hand`` wins or ties everywhere, and it is what the existing MHWS
  rule ``{s}_Palm -> {s}_Hand`` already does.
* End and attachment bones (``ToesEnd``, ``Wep``, ``Prop``, ``GroundAngle``,
  ``Null_Offset``) carry no joint semantics, so they are placed at the reference
  model's own parent-relative offset, unscaled.
* Never walk up the parent chain looking for somewhere to hang a bone.  That was
  proposed and the data refused it: ``L_Knee``'s parent ``L_Thigh`` is 400 mm away at
  the hip, and "distance to parent" does not separate helpers from real joints either
  (of MHWilds' 137 ``_HJ_`` bones, 118 sit >5 mm from their parent).

This module is free of ``bpy`` so the plan can be unit-tested offline; geometry and
weight transfer live in ``core/mesh_port_ops.py``.
