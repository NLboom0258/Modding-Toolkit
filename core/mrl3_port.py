"""MRL3 -> MDF2 port, planning layer: what one MHWI material becomes in MHWilds.

**Every material becomes ``basic``, unconditionally** (user's decision, 2026-08-16).
That is not a shortcut, it is the only honest reading of the data.  ``core/mdf_port.py``
classifies an RE material by its own ``.mmtr``, and refuses to guess from the name --
right there, because each RE archetype has its own shader.  MHWI has no such signal:
``PL_Mt`` is a one-for-all material, and measured on a model hand-ported to both games
it backs *skin, hair, eye and cloth alike*.  Face and Iris come out byte-identical on
the MHWI side -- same mmtr, same ``surfaceCoef``, same ``alphaCoef``, same texture set
-- yet the author made one skin and the other eye.  There is nothing to classify on.

MHWilds happens to have its own one-for-all material, ``Base_Equip.mmtr``, which is
what this addon ships as the ``basic`` prefab; ``skin`` and ``hair`` are its
specialisations for those surfaces and ``standard`` is its advanced variant, not a
"default".  So a MHWI material maps to ``basic`` and the user promotes it afterwards
with "Convert to another MDF material", which exists for exactly this.

An earlier version branched to ``standard`` when ``alphaCoef[2]`` said the material
was transparent.  Dropped as too clever: on the reference pair that rule would have
sent 2 of 17 materials to ``standard`` while the author had put 14 there, so it
neither reproduced the hand port nor stayed predictable.  Transparency survives as a
*flag* instead -- see ``decode_flags``.

Free of ``bpy``: a table over the shipped prefab, checkable offline.

#
# The shape of the rule is a recognition problem, not a conversion one.  A MHWI
# material that is *flatly* translucent carries no texture saying so -- its albedo is
# white with a constant alpha, or the null_white stand-in, and the transparency lives
# entirely in ``fBaseMapFactor__uiColor``'s A.  Nothing downstream can recover that:
# the albedo's A becomes the ``alpha`` plane and is routed into
# ``AlphaTranslucentOcclusionSSSMap.R``, while the factor goes to ``ColorParam`` --
# both correct for MHWilds, and neither is what MHRS reads for a flat dissolve.
#
# So the two facts are multiplied back together and written where MHRS looks.  The
# emissive test is a guard rather than an input: a material with a patterned emissive
# is doing something the flat reading would misdescribe, so it is left alone.

#: The MHRS property this writes.  ``UseNuki_Dissolve`` is deliberately not touched --
