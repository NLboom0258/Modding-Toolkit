"""Split a mesh into one object per material.

``bpy.ops.mesh.separate(type='MATERIAL')`` already does the geometry work, and
it carries shape keys and vertex groups over to every fragment on its own.  The
tidying afterwards is what makes the result usable:

* every fragment inherits *all* of the source's vertex groups and shape keys,
  including the ones that only ever touched geometry that ended up in a
  different fragment;
* fragments come out named ``Foo.001``, ``Foo.002`` … rather than after the
  material that defined the split.

Deliberately not copied from the addon this was modelled on: it deletes any
shape key whose name contains ``mmd_`` regardless of content (a VRChat-pipeline
habit that would silently eat real keys here), and it stashes the shape key
order in the armature's ``['CUSTOM']`` property, which nothing in this addon
reads.
