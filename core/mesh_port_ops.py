"""RE Mesh port, execution layer: carry out a plan on a real rig, plus the operator.

The planning half is ``core/mesh_port.py``; everything here needs Blender.  Three
decisions shape this file:

**It always works on a copy, and copies the meshes with the armature.**  Two separate
reasons, both load-bearing: editing a rig in place drops the bindings of any RE Chain
data already attached to it, and merging bones has to move *vertex groups*, which live
on the meshes -- copy the armature alone and the weights have nowhere to go.  (The
chain port is the opposite: it edits in place, because duplicating a chain collection
would leave its links pointing at the original's groups by object name.)

**Bone orientation is changed by posing and applying, not by writing edit_bones.**
``core/pose_ops.py`` already solved this shape of problem: pose the bones, then
``_apply_and_rebind()`` bakes the pose into the rest skeleton and re-binds the meshes,
so skinning follows the change instead of tearing.  Writing rest matrices directly
would leave every mesh bound to the old rest.

**The axis correction C is derived from the two rigs at run time, never from a baked
table of constants.**  Bone *positions* differ per character by 130-160 mm between
body types while orientations do not, so anything position-shaped must be measured on
the actual asset.  C itself is gated by ``core.bone_correction``: bones whose derived C
is not a signed permutation fall back to the validated table or are reported -- never
silently replaced by identity, which would leave that bone in the source game's
convention with nothing to show for it until an animation twists it in-game.
