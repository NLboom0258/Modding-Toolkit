"""MRL3 -> MDF2 port, execution layer.

One MHWI ``.mrl3`` collection in, one MHWilds ``.mdf2`` collection out, with the
textures actually recoded rather than left pointing at MT Framework paths.

Three things are borrowed wholesale rather than rebuilt, because the RE-to-RE port
already does them and a second copy would drift:

* ``re_mdf_presets.readPresetJSON`` builds the destination material from the shipped
  ``basic`` prefab -- the same call ``core/mdf_port_ops.py`` makes,
* ``mdf_tex_processor_base._compose_channels`` packs PBR planes into a MHWilds slot,
* ``mdf_port_tex.write_ported_tex`` puts the result on disk under MHWilds' own naming
  and container conventions.

What is new here is the front half of the texture path.  The RE-to-RE port unpacks one
source slot at a time, because RE games' slots correspond one to one; MHWI's do not,
so a whole material's slots are decoded together and taken apart into PBR planes by
``core/mrl3_port_tex.py`` before any of them is repacked.  ``RMTMap`` alone feeds three
different MHWilds slots.

Source textures are read off disk, not out of Blender: MHWI's importer converts to a
preview format, and porting the preview would ship a re-encoded, sometimes rescaled
copy of the texture instead of the one the mod actually has.  MHWI's own on-disk
convention is ``<natives root>/nativePC/<mapList value>.tex`` -- no ``Art/`` prefix and
no version suffix, both of which the RE side has.

#:
#: Measured before choosing (2026-08-16).  Of the 23 mrl3 destinations that exist
#: in Base_Equip, 6 survive the second hop; of the 17 that do not, **15 have no
#: counterpart in MHRS at all** -- PL_Default is a single shader with no
#: RoughnessParam, no ColorParam, no SSS and no ColorLayer, so a direct table
#: could not carry them either.  A whole parallel pipeline would buy 8 of 23
#: instead of 6.
#:
#: Texture quality does *not* make the extra hop free, though -- an earlier
#: version of this comment claimed all 15 MHWS slot types map onto an MHRS slot
#: with an identical channel layout, which measuring the actual shipped
#: presets disproves: MHWS's ``NormalRoughnessOcclusionMap`` (R=roughness,
#: G/A=octahedral normal, B=AO) and MHRS's ``NRMR_NRRTMap`` (R/G=plain normal,
#: B=const, A=roughness) are not the same layout, and MHWS's
#: ``AlphaTranslucentOcclusionSSSMap`` has no counterpart in MHRS's own
#: ``standard`` prefab at all.  So the second hop goes through the ordinary
#: cross-game material port with texture conversion genuinely switched on --
#: same family-based slot matching and channel repack any other cross-game
#: port uses (see ``relay``) -- rather than a raw path copy.

    them away would turn a partial port into no port at all.

    Texture conversion is genuinely switched on here (unless *paths_only*),
    not skipped: MHWilds' and MHRS's slot vocabularies are not the same (see
    ``TARGET_GAMES``) -- MHWilds' ``NormalRoughnessOcclusionMap`` and MHRS's
    ``NRMR_NRRTMap`` pack different quantities into different channels, and
    MHWilds' ``AlphaTranslucentOcclusionSSSMap`` has no MHRS counterpart at
    all. A plain name-keyed path copy would silently drop the normal map's AO
    channel and the whole alpha/translucency/AO pack. The ordinary cross-game
    port already resolves this correctly -- exact name match first, then a
    unique same-family slot (``mdf_port_tex.find_dst_slot_type``), with a real
    channel repack wherever the layouts differ (``mdf_port_tex.repack_slot``)
    -- so this hop uses it rather than reimplementing a second, worse version.

    It reads the source bytes from *src_scratch_root* -- ``run_port``'s own
    scratch directory, not the user's real MHWilds mod root, which this relay
    has no reason to touch or even require to be set.

    ``octahedral_normals=True`` is not offered to the user for this hop: it is
    not a choice, it is a fact about what ``run_port`` just wrote.
    ``port_textures`` always composes MHWilds' octahedral normal slots (NRRO
    and kin) with ``octahedral=True``, so decoding them back out here has to
    agree.

    *paths_only* skips the byte read/write -- there is nothing at
