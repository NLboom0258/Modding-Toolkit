"""Reference-model import: which model each game has, and what "merge" means on it.

A reference model is a vanilla body straight from the game -- the thing you rig
against, measure against, and port onto.  Every game ships one somewhere different,
so the table below is the single place that knows where:

===== ====================================== ===========================================
game  source                                 how it is read
===== ====================================== ===========================================
MHWI  assets/mhwi/body/                      MHW Model Editor's MOD3 importer
MHWS  assets/reference_skeletons/mhws/       Blender's FBX importer
MHRS  assets/mhrs/shadow/                    RE Mesh Editor's mesh importer
RE4   assets/reference_skeletons/re4/        Blender's FBX importer
RE9   assets/reference_skeletons/re9/        Blender's FBX importer
DMC5  assets/dmc5/reference_models/          RE Mesh Editor's mesh importer
===== ====================================== ===========================================

Only MHWS/RE4/RE9 are FBX.  MHWI and MHRS are the games' own native model files,
bundled as-is and read by the addon that understands them, because FBX cannot carry
them intact: Blender's FBX exporter serialises an *array* custom property to a
string, and MOD3 keeps one (``Mod3_Mesh_Unkn``, an int array).  Measured on the
bundled body -- the three scalar ``Mod3_Mesh_*`` properties and both per-bone
properties survive a round trip, but that one comes back as ``"[0, 0, 0, 48]"``, and
MHW Model Editor's exporter then dies writing it (``struct.error: required argument
is not an integer``).  Bone lengths are lost too, which does *not* matter: MOD3
export never reads them, and the importer synthesises the tail from the head.

So the dependency for these two is on the *importer*, never on another addon for
the model itself.  MHWI users already need MHW Model Editor to export their mods,
so this costs them nothing and drops the previous dependency on Modder Batch Tool.

DMC5 is the other native-file case, for the opposite reason: its player bodies are
``.mesh`` and RE Mesh Editor already reads the whole thing -- mesh, armature and
all -- so there is nothing to convert and no second addon to depend on either.
These are the four playable characters' own bodies, bundled as the game ships them
(byte-identical to the unpacked originals, verified by hash).

The facial merge does not apply to DMC5: its facial rig is a *separate head
skeleton*, not a subtree of the body, so there is nothing on this rig for it to
collapse (``has_facial_rig``).  The auxiliary merge does apply, and DMC5 is the one
game here where it is genuinely destructive: its ``fbxskel`` carries the joint
skeleton only (64 bones on pl0100, against MHWilds' close-to-full-body 224), so on
an imported vanilla body every cloth, hair and physics bone counts as auxiliary.
``assets/native_skeletons/base_bones.json`` carries that warning on the entry
itself, and the option stays off by default.  The T-pose switch is live too:
``core/pose_ops.py`` already carries a DMC5 bone list, so this costs nothing here.

MHWI and MHRS get no post-import options: their bodies have no facial rig and no
auxiliary bones, and both ship in T-pose, so every switch below would be a no-op.

**The two merges.**  Both answer "collapse these bones into the nearest bone that
survives, taking their weights with them", which is the algorithm MBT uses on MHWilds
facial bones and which ``games/mhws/operators.py`` already carries.  They differ only
in which bones are doomed:

* **facial** -- everything under the game's facial root.  MHWilds is listed explicitly
  instead (``_MHWS_FACIAL_MERGE_BONES``, ported from MBT) because its facial rig is
  not one clean subtree.
* **auxiliary** -- every bone the game's *native* skeleton does not have.  The base
  sets are read from the real skeleton files shipped in ``assets/`` and baked into
  ``assets/native_skeletons/base_bones.json`` (MHWS 224 bones, RE4 137, RE9 85), so
  the rule needs no hand-maintained list of helpers.

Auxiliary merging deliberately **excludes the facial subtree**, even though those
bones are absent from the base skeletons too (measured: MHWilds' bonesystem skeleton
has no ``HeadAll_SCL``, no ``fcParam_*``, no ``*_LOD0*``).  Without that exclusion,
ticking only "merge auxiliary" would silently take the whole face with it, and the two
checkboxes would not be independent.

MHWS needs one extra source.  Its native ``bonesystem`` skeleton *contains* the 137
``_HJ_`` helpers (measured: 224 bones, ``Hip_HJ_00`` and friends among them), so "not
in the native skeleton" finds only 5 bones on the reference body and the option would
be a no-op.  What "auxiliary" means for MHWilds is precisely what its bone preset
already registers under ``aux``, so that list is added for MHWS -- and only for MHWS,
because elsewhere ``aux`` holds genuine native joints (RE9's ``L_Leg_Foot`` and
``L_Hand_Palm`` are real bones; merging them would break the rig).

MHRS and MHWI have no native skeleton file here either, which is consistent with them
having no auxiliary bones to merge in the first place.

This module holds no ``bpy`` so the merge planning is unit-testable offline.
